# Tic Tac Wars
* Date: 2017/03/07
* Author: Lance Takiguchi
* Description: A hackaton group project to make a Firebase 
multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game, one to allow for play on different
computers. Given we were crash course trying Firebase, we
had to cut cross-computer feature last minute.

## Version team3
* Date: 2017/03/07
#### Description: Finalized, Presentation Version
* Updated README to have links, a screenshot, a planned addtions section, learning section.
* Upload project to github and website.

## The Learning Experince
This was a fun experience, and we learned much. We quickly decided
on having an Advanced Wars theme and just split the work and did our own things
: One on HTML & CSS, another for Firebase, and me on JS 
logic. As a result, we had good difficulty combining our parts. 
In the end, Firebase never worked how we needed it to, the HTML
& CSS worked, but could use more polishing time, and the JavaScript
was a nightmare spaghetti code for others to try to use. We did
not win this hackathon, but it was entertaining to see our
lack of teamwork and look forward to our next hackathon. 

Looking back at this at this hackathon, I have learned that there is a
need for pre-planning. We just started coding, which can work,
especially given the time constant of about 48 hours, but planning
most of it out helps me a ton. Figuring out all the features of the app,
rating the importance and difficulty to decide the order of production.
This helps the future become much more visible, and everyone knows
what work is ahead of the team. It also de-stresses a seemingly
large and monstrous task by cutting it up into small parts that you
do know how to code.

## Web Development Utilized 
* Firebase
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* git

## Given More Time
* Change theme to something with responsive assets
* Fix Firebase server game play
* Redo the JavaScript logic to make it simplier

## Future Features
* Application descriptions.
* Display a message for non-desktop screens.
* Add my contacts on a footer navbar.

- Presentation

### Instructions for participants:
- Pick a person to be project lead
